# Hopper
Electric bikes enable you to travel faster & further so that you get better connections. But they also have special needs such as safe parking.

Hopper is a **route-planner** that takes all those needs into account and allows you to combine your e-bike with train journeys. Change your commuting habits and contribute to sustainability!

Hopper is powered by Linked Open Data and [Itinero](https://www.itinero.tech/).
